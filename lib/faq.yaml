- question: |
    Can I make more than one project at a workshop?

    and workshop projects, please check back with us often to schedule!

- question: |
    I have a friend who didn’t buy a spot and would like to tag along. Is this allowed?
  answer: |
    We are sorry but this is not allowed. Our workshop only has space for a certain number of
    guests, because of this and safety issues we cannot allow anyone that does not have a paid spot
    reserved to come and hang out.

- question: |
    Do I need to be crafty or artistically talented to take a workshop?

    Definitely NOT!  Our workshops provide guided instruction in a relaxed environment.
    Just bring your DIY attitude and a willingness to learn and you will create a project you
    will be proud of!
