          I understand this is a Wood Workshop, so my sign MAY HAVE random cracks, chips, knots, and
          other NATURAL blemishes that give it itâ€™s characteristics.

          I have entered the correct design and/or customization info. I understand that NO CHANGES
          can be made to my design choice OR any personalization once my reservation is submitted.

          I have read and agree to the
          %a{href: workshop_policies_path(workshop)}= "#{workshop.workshop_type.name} Workshop Policies."
          I understand that because projects at Sign Junkie are hand-made, there is a NO REFUND policy
          in place. If I must cancel my reservation I must find someone to come in my place. If I arrive
          later than 20 minutes after the start time, the reservation fee I am about to pay will be forfeited.
          I also understand that NO unfinsihed projects will be given if I fail to attend this workshop.
