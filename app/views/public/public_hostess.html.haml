        Hostess Guidelines for Group Bookings

%p
  Canâ€™t meet the minimum requirements of guests for a Private Workshop? The Group Booking option is a great way to
  secure seats for your group in our Public Workshop. There is a minimum of 4 guests required and you may reserve
  up to 8 guests.

%p
  In order to secure THIS date, you MUST submit the $50. deposit and meet the following requirements. Please read
  below to see what is required to get your $50. deposit refunded.

%p
  As the hostess, YOU are responsible for inviting guests and making sure they register by the workshop deadline,
  which is clearly listed on your registration link. The deadline for ALL guest to register is 7 days prior to
  your event.

%p
  ALL guests that plan to attend MUST register by the deadline! ONLY those who have registered can enter the
  workshop so please be sure everyone registers! Note: The ONLY exception to this is if the event is a kid or
  family friendly workshop. ONLY then may an unregistered guest enter the workshop to assist a child with their
  project. Thanks for cooperation!

%p
  Everyone attending an ADULT workshop MUST be 16 years of age or older. If the public workshop is listed as a
  kid or family friendly workshop, children over the age of 8 are welcome to attend. EVERY child attending
  between the age of 8-17 years old must have a paid reservation and a parent guardian with them to sign a
  %a{href: waiver_path} Waiver of Liability
  form. NO drop-offs so plan on staying until your child is done at the event.


%p
  Please make sure you and your guests arrive 15-20 minutes before the start of your event. Anyone arriving more than
  15 minutes late will NOT be allowed to enter and their registration fee will NOT be returned. EVERYONE must sign a
  %a{href: waiver_path} Waiver of Liability
  form upon arrival.

  registers and has to cancel, their registration fee will be forfeited. We suggest you work with them to find someone
  to take their place and do the project that was selected. Keep in mind, your deposit will only be refunded IF all
  reserved seats are filled the day of the event. Please only reserve seats for guests you have confirmed.

  %span.text-info Deposit Refund:
  To get your $50. deposit back, ALL reserved seats MUST be filled AND attend your event. The deposit will be refunded
  within 48 hours after your event takes place. If you, the hostess, fails to fill all seats reserved by the deadline

  %span.text-info Project Change Request:
  Please note, the design you choose at registration will be the design you receive at your workshop. Please check your
  spelling. No changes may be made once hour order is placed. We would be happy to accommodate your request for a
  design change for a $10. stencil re-cut fee, payable upon the start of your workshop. Email
  %a{href: "mailto:#{ClientInfo.contact_email}"}= ClientInfo.contact_email
  to request a stencil design change.

  %span.text-info No Project Do-Overs:
  Sorry, there is NO project do-overs! The instructors advice and assist you in the selection of paint/stain colors,
  and techniques but ultimately the final color and technique choice is yours. Once you leave the workshop you can
  NOT request to come back and do your project over because you wish later that you would have chosen differently.
  Thanks for your understanding!
