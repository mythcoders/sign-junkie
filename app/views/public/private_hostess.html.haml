  As the hostess, YOU are responsible for inviting guests and making sure they register by your workshop deadline,
  which is clearly listed on your registration link. The deadline for ALL guest to register is 7 days prior to
  your event.

  Private workshops will have exclusive access of our workshop for 3 hours on the date and time you secure. ALL guests
  that plan to attend MUST register by the deadline! ONLY those who have registered can enter the workshop so please
  be sure everyone registers! Note: The ONLY exception to this is if the event is a kid or family friendly workshop.
  ONLY then may an unregistered guest enter the workshop to assist a child with their project. Thanks for cooperation!

%p
  Everyone attending an ADULT workshop MUST be 16 years of age or older. If you reserve a Private Workshop for your child,
  children over the age of 8 are welcome to attend. EVERY child attending between the age of 8-17 years old must have a paid
  reservation and a parent guardian with them to sign a
  %a{href: waiver_path} Waiver of Liability
  form. NO drop-offs so plan on staying until your child is done at the event.

%p
  Please make sure you and your guests arrive 15-20 minutes before the start of your event. Anyone arriving more than
  15 minutes late will NOT be allowed to enter and their registration fee will NOT be returned. EVERYONE must sign a
  %a{href: waiver_path} Waiver of Liability
