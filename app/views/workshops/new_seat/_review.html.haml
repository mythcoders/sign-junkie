    Due to COVID-19 I understand that I MUST have my temperature taken upon arrival
    and before entering Sign Junkie. I MUST also provide my own mask to wear throughout the
    entire workshop. If I DO NOT comply I will NOT be able to attend this workshop and will
    NOT receive a refund.

    I understand this is a Wood Workshop, so my sign MAY HAVE random cracks, chips, knots, and
    other NATURAL blemishes that give it itâ€™s characteristics.

    I have read and agree to the
    %a{href: workshop_policies_path(@workshop)}= "#{@workshop.workshop_type.name} Workshop Policies."
    I understand that because projects at Sign Junkie are hand-made, there is a NO REFUND policy
    in place. If I must cancel my reservation I must find someone to come in my place. If I arrive
    later than 20 minutes after the start time, the reservation fee I am about to pay will be forfeited.
    I also understand that NO unfinsihed projects will be given if I fail to attend this workshop.
